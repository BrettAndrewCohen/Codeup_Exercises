// Create a new file named national_parks.php for these exercises. Use PDO for all queries, nothing should be done directly in MySQL or Sequel Pro. 
// Between each step commit your changes to Git. At the end the exercise, push all your commits to GitHub.

// Create a page that lists the national parks from your database. On each page load, it should retrieve all records from the database and display them.

// Modify your page to only load four parks at a time and add links to go the next or previous pages.

// Modify your query to load the appropriate parks given which page the user is on. 
// You should accept one or two parameters from $_GET and use them to load the appropriate parks.
